# This looks more promising, as it seems that the lower the rank, the higher the acceptance rate. Let's use the rank
# as one of our inputs. In order to do this, we should one-hot encode it.

# One-hot encoding the rank
# Use the get_dummies function in Pandas in order to one-hot encode the data.

# Make dummy variables for rank
one_hot_data = pd.concat([data, pd.get_dummies(data['rank'],  prefix='rank')], axis=1)

# Scaling the data
# The next step is to scale the data. We notice that the range for grades is 1.0-4.0, whereas the range for test scores
# is roughly 200-800, which is much larger. This means our data is skewed, and that makes it hard for a neural network
# to handle. Let's fit our two features into a range of 0-1, by dividing the grades by 4.0, and the test score by 800.

# Making a copy of our data
processed_data = one_hot_data[:]

# Scale the columns
processed_data['gpa'] = processed_data['gpa'] / 4.0
